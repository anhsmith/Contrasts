Description: This contains some functions to convert a factor with k levels into a set of k-1 orthogonal sum-to-zero contrasts that are weighted by the inverse sample sizes of the groups. It does not assign contrasts to a factor in the traditional way. There is also a function for creating contrasts for a factor y nested in x.
